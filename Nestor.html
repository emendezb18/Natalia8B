    <center> <p class="texto">The Korean War was a proxy conflict of the Cold War, with the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism serving as a backdrop. The conflict ended in an armistice in 1953, establishing the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) along the 38th parallel, but a formal peace treaty was never signed, and technically, the two Koreas remain at war. Allies: South Korea was supported by United Kingdom and U.S, and North Korea by China and the Soviet Union</center></p>
